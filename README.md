# 52 weeks, 52 projects

The **52 weeks, 52 projects** challenge states that I should make one projects every week, for 52 weeks. It doesn't state what kind of project should I make or anything else related to that. But I have a long list of technologies I'd like to try and test, so I probably will have a lot to do.


## Week 1
The project I developed in the first week is called [Kotlin on Android](https://github.com/aziflaj/ToDo-kotlin/) and is a simple "ToDo" application built entirely in Kotlin.
