# 52 weeks, 52 projects

The **52 weeks, 52 projects** challenge states that I should make one projects every week, for 52 weeks. It doesn't state what kind of project should I make or anything else related to that. But I have a long list of technologies I'd like to try and test, so I probably will have a lot to do.


## Week 1
The project I developed in the first week is called [Kotlin on Android](https://github.com/aziflaj/ToDo-kotlin/) and is a simple "ToDo" application built entirely in Kotlin. Read my [blog post](https://aziflaj.github.io/week-1-challenge-kotlin-in-android/) about it.

## Week 2
In the second week of the challenge, I went into front-end web development tools and frameworks, messing around with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) (v1), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (Sassy CSS). I tried to make my own invoice generator, or at least [its front end](https://github.com/aziflaj/simple-invoices-frontend). It is just the frontend, so it doesn't do anything for the moment, but later I will wire it with a backend service which will store the previous invoices by the user into the DB. Here's my [blog post](https://aziflaj.github.io/week-2-report-angularjs-gulp/) for the second week.

## Week 3
In the third week, I dealt with [Vagrant and Chef](https://github.com/aziflaj/vagrant-chef). I use Vagrant for creating virtual environments, and Chef for provisioning the VM. Until now, I've been using [laravel's Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/homestead) and [PuPHPet](http://puphpet.com/) for creating these VMs. Instead of Chef, PuPHPet uses [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/), but it is focused only in PHP projects. Using Chef and manually configuring VMs, allows me to create Virtual Environments for every kind of project, including other languages except PHP.
